    title: "About Me"
    content: |-
      I am a librarian with a technical and research portfolio beyond conventional librariaship. 
      I lead and collaborate with interdisciplinary initiatives that apply machine learning and natural language processing 
      to real-world problems—partnering with faculty and students to analyze how AI is used in medicine, 
      engineering clickbait classifiers to understand linguistic influence on engagement, and developing terabyte-scale 
      topic models that reconceptualize archival data as stratigraphic records of human intellectual history.
      
      I also provide strategic and technical leadership for Northwestern University Library’s portfolio of 
      peer-reviewed scholarly journals. I oversee the digital infrastructure and technical workflow 
      for titles including Studies in Russian Philosophy, Literature, and Religious Thought and The 
      Bulletin of Applied Transgender Studies.

      I prefer working with complex information representation over simple numbers. Network/graph analysis, natural language
      processing, and computer vision is what my heart desires.
